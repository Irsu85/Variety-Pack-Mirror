# Variety-Pack-Mirror
This is a mirror for Variety Pack maintained by Irsu85, made by Brawlbox

This mirror only goes back until version 3.1.1 since thats the oldest version I had when making this repo

## How to use

There is a Releases tab on the right of this page (if you are on desktop) which says the current latest release of Variety Pack that is in this repo. You can download the sources zip file for every release that is visible. You have to put both the riivolution and the vp3 (or another number, depending of the version) folders in the root of your SD card, and boot up Riivo. If you play on Dolphin, idk just do dolphin riivo stuff
